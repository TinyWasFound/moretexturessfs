# moretexturessfs
Adds 14 NEW Textures to Spaceflight Simulator.
Textures: Red, Orange, Yellow, Light Yellow, Swamp Green, Green, Baby Blue, Light Blue, Dark Blue, Purple, Gray, Darker Black, Silver Foil, Gold Foil, (more coming soon)
If you have texturable mod then you can add these to more than just the default fuel tanks, nose cones, and seperators. ![image](https://github.com/TinyWasFound/moretexturessfs/assets/111200283/49e5f2c9-4989-4cf6-b989-5547cd71139d)

DM rl.xjake on Discord to suggest changes, report bugs, or give new texture ideas.


To add the textures, go into sfs local files, Steam>Steamapps>Common>SpaceflightSimulator>SpaceflightSimulatorGame>Mods>Custom Assets>Texture Packs and drop the 4 files that you unzipped, Color Textures, Shadow Textures, Shape Textures, Textures, into the folder, load up SFS and then you should be good. If it does not work contact me with the username above.
